# Climping Pyramid Visualizer

![demo pyramid](demo.png)

## Current Requirements

You need an environment which can run `python`, such as a `conda` environment.

In addition, you will need to install the following packages:

* `pandas`
* `plotly`
* `dash`

All of which can be installed via `pip`.

## To run

Ensure the file `app.py` is executable:

```
chmod +x app.py
```

Then simply run the app via the terminal with `./app.py` (you will need to copy/paste the URL into a web browser).
